>This is a software realizing decision tree

# decision tree
## introduction
- This project implements a decision tree learning algorithm, run experiments on real datasets.I handle data with:
an arbitrary number of (continuous) numeric-valued features
an arbitrary number of output classes, and
an arbitrary number of example training instances.
- This program is able to interpret the data format specified below, produce a human readable version of the decision tree formed from a data set, and able to use the decision tree to classify instances (producing, of course, interesting statistics on the output trees such as accuracy and size).
## How can you run?
- Run testtree.py and change labels in testtree.py use the document in my file.
